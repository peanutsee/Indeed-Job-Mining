Work type: Contract, full-time
Singapore University of Technology and Design’s Meta Design Lab in collaboration with the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities is calling for a Postdoctoral Fellow for a new project.
Project Description
This project aims to investigate the relationship between macro-urban configurations and its effect on the wellness of residents, focusing specifically on the elderly. It hypothesises that much of a resident’s ambient exercise and positive health aspects of a city are a product of how people navigate it on a data-to-day basis. However, the relationship between urban configurations and individual wellness has not been empirically correlated except in small scale studies or general correlations (e.g. average distance travelled against health). This research aims to take a significantly more analytical and spatially focused approach, considering and ideally correlating how an urban area effects users’ activity and decisions.
To do this it will integrate three concurrent areas of study;
1. An AI driven tracking approach to see where people go and what they do
2. An in-depth ethnographic study of resident residential activity and health
3. A design intervention into healthier residential spaces and development of design guidelines
This position focuses on supporting the first part of this and is intended to be develop a data driven approach to urban analysis, by providing insight into how people use space by using ethnical and anonymised image tracking of users of public spaces developing ML models to improve aggregate user route monitoring and identification of activity location. This will be correlated with spatial configuration of buildings, origin-destination modelling, and available route choice analysis (spatial network). Then using this empirical data as a source to do machine learning to predict space use, computing resultant health metrics, leading to automated appraisal of the wellness of the space. This work will be scaled to larger areas where possible to develop data for use in deriving more insight into user activity in tandem with the ethnographic study as data triangulation. Combing both these sources to allow for better informed developing of policy and design guidelines to improve future urban design and potentially building more user focused ML tools for urban planners.
The research is highly disciplinary but anchored in Architecture, Urban Planning and Applied A.I. and lead by, Belinda Yuen (LKYCIC), Sam Joyce (SUTD), Ngai-Man Cheung (SUTD), and Joshua Comaroff (Yale-NUS) each covering aspects of planning for wellness, applied computational design, A.I., and architectural design respectively.

Researcher Description
We are keen to take on someone who is enthusiastic about conceiving, implementing and testing technologies such as AI, ML, and computer vision to spatial problems, specifically urban analytics and design. The project is intended an investigation into the capability of ML to apply to measuring wellness and design effectiveness in the real world. It would suit someone who is more exploratory and curious about applying novel approaches. The job aims to give a motivated self-starter the research freedom and space to explore new concepts, supported and guided within a group of domain experts with strong academic and industrial backgrounds. The SUTD environment is that of a start-up university and so well suited to those with initiative both professionally and socially.
The hire will be directly report to Sam Joyce and act as part of the Meta Design Lab but will supported by Ngai-Man Cheung and his team for support in AI, ML, and image recognition aspects. They will also work closely with LKYCIC in terms of understanding wellness and health aspects and data needs for the user capture and monitoring. This project has support to capture data from government agencies and for potential wider implementation based on findings. The project will also collaborate with an industry leading company to leverage their image recognition technology-pipeline to support our activities as well as supporting potentially translational efforts if the technology is successful.
