I exemplified the use of mysql-connector-python to connect python to localhost mysql database.
Error I ran into (and was persistant), wrong version of my-sql-connector for the wrong version of mysql. 
Download mysql-connector-python instead of mysql-connector, or you could set auth plugin to the non default value.
